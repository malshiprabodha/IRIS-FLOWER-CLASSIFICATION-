# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This project predicts the species of Iris flowers (*Setosa*, *Versicolor*, *Virginica*) based on petal and sepal dimensions using machine learning.

## Overview
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics.  
In this project, we perform **data analysis**, **visualization**, and **model training** to classify flowers accurately.

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Exploration** – Loaded and inspected the Iris dataset.  
2. **Data Visualization** – Created pair plots and correlation heatmaps using Seaborn.  
3. **Model Training** – Used algorithms such as:
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree Classifier  
   - Random Forest Classifier  
4. **Model Evaluation** – Compared models based on accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn
